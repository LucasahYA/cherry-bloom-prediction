# cherry-bloom-prediction

#### **Project Overview**
This project predicts cherry blossom bloom dates using meteorological data and machine learning models. The dataset is built from NOAA climate data, and features are engineered based on temperature accumulation, precipitation, and extreme weather conditions. The final model is trained using various regression techniques, with **ElasticNet** selected as the best-performing model.

### **Repository Structure**
- ðŸ“‚ **`data_cleaning_preprocessing`**  
  - Preprocesses and cleans historical weather data.  
  - Removes long missing periods, fills gaps using rolling averages, and ensures continuous time series.  
  - Aligns data with a **seasonal year (Marchâ€“next year's February)** for better feature extraction.  

- ðŸ“‚ **`request_station_id`**  
  - Uses the NOAA API to find the nearest weather station ID based on bloom observation locations.  
  - Queries the **Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCND)** dataset.  

- ðŸ“‚ **`request_weather`**  
  - Fetches historical daily weather records (TMAX, TMIN, PRCP) from NOAA using the retrieved station IDs.  
  - Aggregates data into a structured CSV format.  

- ðŸ“‚ **`Training_Predicting`**  
  - Trains machine learning models (**Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet**) on processed weather data.  
  - Tunes hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** and evaluates model performance.  
  - Predicts bloom **DOY (day of year)** for multiple locations.

### **Data Processing Workflow**
1. **Fetch station IDs** for bloom observation locations using the NOAA API (`request_station_id`).
2. **Retrieve weather data** from NOAA for the identified stations (`request_weather`).
3. **Preprocess data** by filling missing values, removing non-continuous periods, and engineering features (`data_cleaning_preprocessing`).
4. **Train regression models** and optimize hyperparameters (`Training_Predicting`).
5. **Generate bloom predictions** for selected locations.

### **Feature Engineering**
- **Seasonal Temperature & Precipitation**: Aggregated Tmax, Tmin, and PRCP for Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.  
- **Growing Degree Days (GDD)**: Accumulated warmth above 5Â°C over 30, 60, and 120 days.  
- **Rolling Trends**: 7-day & 30-day temperature and precipitation trends.  
- **Extreme Weather Indicators**: Frost days (Tmin < 0Â°C), heat days (Tmax > 25Â°C).
